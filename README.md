👋 Hi there, I'm Manuel! I'm starting my journey as a web developer. For the past few years, I've been dedicated to research in the Humanities, but I recently made the leap into the world of computing—a passion I've had since childhood.

I've explored and worked with various technologies, but I’m currently focusing on JavaScript and Python for web development.
